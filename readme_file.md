### Expo Router, React Components, and NativeWind Integration in React Native
#### Understanding Expo Router
Expo Router is a powerful file-based routing system for React Native applications built on top of Expo. It simplifies navigation by allowing developers to define screens using a folder structure, similar to Next.js for web development. Instead of manually configuring navigation stacks, developers can create files in the app/ directory, and Expo Router automatically generates the necessary routes.
